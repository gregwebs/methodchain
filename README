== Summary
methodchain - ruby helpers for method chaining: chain, tap, then, else
Easy ways to navigate around nil without creating local variables.

== Examples
=== ##tap
if you don't already know about this method, look it up on the net.  The tap included here allows message sending.

==== OLD WAY
  arr = [1]
  arr.compact! # => nil
  arr.first # => 1

==== Normal Tap (still valid)
  [1].tap {|arr| arr.compact!}.first # => 1

==== NEW Tap
  [1].tap(:compact!).first # => 1

=== ##then and ##else
==== OLD WAY
  person = nil
  name = person ? person.name : nil

==== NEW WaY
  name = person.then {|p| p.name}

not a huge savings. But sometimes the person variable is actually a function call, and then we must save it in a variable first.

==== OLD WAY
  def find(*args)
    # do some expensive database queries
  end

  location = find(:first)
  @phone = location && location.phone   # => nil

==== NEW WaY
  @phone = find(:first).then {phone}   # => nil
  
We have reduced a line of code and removed a local variable.
#then and #else can return a default value instead of evaluating a block

  'a'.then('b') #=> 'b'
  nil.then('b').else('c') #=> 'c'

=== ##chain
==== OLD WAY
  customer = nil
  customer && customer.order && customer.order.id

==== NEW WaY
  customer.chain(:order, :id)
 
note that this is equivalent to

  customer.then {order}.then {id}

=== ##chain - Custom guards, multiple arguments, and procs
==== OLD WAY - guarding against zero
  value = 0

  result = if value == 0 then value else
    tmp = value.abs

    if tmp == 0 then tmp else
      tmp * 20
    end
  end
  result # => 0

==== NEW WAY
  value.chain(:abs, [:*, 20]) {|s| s == 0 }   # => 0

procs can be used, so this is equivalent to
  value.chain(:abs, lambda {|n| n * 20 }) {|s| s == 0 } # => 0

== Usage
  require 'rubygems'

=== import all MethodChain methods into Object

  require 'methodchain'

=== selectively import MethodChain methods

  require 'methodchain/not_included'

not_included will load the MethodChain module without including it anywhere.
Already have your own version of tap? use the module-import gem to decide what to include

== Implementation
* There are no proxy objects and no use of method_missing- these are simply function calls, so it should be fast.
* A helper method called yield_or_eval is also exposed.  This method allows the two different block forms {|p| p.name} and {name}, where the first form yields self and the second form is called using instance_eval.
